SPRINT-2 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

1. Properly tested working system deployed on an online hosting platform.
2. Code with readable comments uploaded in “Development/Sprint-2” folder of your project’s Github repository.
3. 3-4 minutes video that explains the functionality of your system developed so far. This must be uploaded in “Sprint-2” folder of your project’s Github repository.
4. Updated architecture and data model must be uploaded in the respective folders on Github.
5. Test case execution report. 
6. Update project schedule.  
7. This "Readme" file should be uploaded in Sprint-2 folder.

HOW TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM

1. The documentation site can be visited on http://ezbase.vercel.app
2. The SDK can be downloaded on npm repository on https://www.npmjs.com/package/ezbase-ts
3. The server will be downloadable from the documentation site in the upcoming sprints (we have had issues with making an executable for windows. Linux and mac executables are done), however for it can be run be following the steps below:
    - Go to the server repository in Sprint 1
    - Execute cargo run on the terminal to start the server
4. The UI can also be locally accessed and run by following the steps below:
    - In frontend directory, execute pnpm i
    - Then execute pnpm run dev on the terminal to start the UI

    In the upcoming sprints the UI will be bundled with the server and when the server starts, the UI will also start on a separate port

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1. As this sprint was spent converting the entire codebase to Typescript due to complexities faced in debugging and expanding the rust backend system, this sprint was spent in migrating the server and sdk to typescript.
2. As the functionality remains constant therefore the demo videos in sprint 1 should suffice for this sprint.
