HOW TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM

1. The documentation site can be visited on http://ezbase.vercel.app
2. The SDK can be downloaded on npm repository on https://www.npmjs.com/package/ezbase-ts
3. The steps to use our system
    - Go to the server repository in Sprint 4
    - run bun i or pnpm i and then bun/pnpm run dev
    - Go to sdk folder run npm i and then npm run build
    - Go to frontend folder run pnpm i and then pnpm run dev

* A deployment does exist at https://ezbase-frontend.vercel.app/ , However the backend is deployed on Koyeb which provides ephemeral disk storage
and may result in varying performance. Also refrain from stress testing too much as heavy traffic may incur hosting costs. For file related
stuff please see the demo video as file storage on an actual deployed server is expensive.
